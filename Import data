read_csv2() reads semicolon-separated files. These use ; instead of , to separate fields and are common in countries that use , as the decimal marker.

read_tsv() reads tab-delimited files.

read_delim() reads in files with any delimiter, attempting to automatically guess the delimiter if you donâ€™t specify it.

read_fwf() reads fixed-width files. You can specify fields by their widths with fwf_widths() or by their positions with fwf_positions().

read_table() reads a common variation of fixed-width files where columns are separated by white space.

read_log() reads Apache-style log files.
